# RepositoryMerger

RepositoryMerger is a tool for merging existing Git repositories into a monorepo while keeping their commit history,
originally created for [the monorepo migration of RSpec project](hhttps://github.com/rspec/rspec-core/issues/2509#issuecomment-939110402).

It's (hopefully) generic and not only for the RSpec repos.
The RSpec-specific things are extracted to https://github.com/yujinakayama/rspec-monorepo-migration.
